<h1>One Platform Foundation</h1>
<p>
We want to make it easier for Android developers to submit their applications to several application stores. 
Our first project is AppDF (Application Description File) - a format for describing Android application in one file.  
</p>

<h2>AppDF</h2>
<p>
  Uploading Android application to several appstores could be time consuming operation. 
  AppDF format is designed to simplify this process. You describe your Android application once, create a 
  simple AppDF archive that includes the XML description, APK file(s), screenshots, app icon, promo images, etc 
  and just upload this AppDF file to all the stores that support AppDF uploading.
</p>

<h3>What Is AppDF File?</h3>
<p>
  AppDF file is a ZIP archive with .appdf extension. This archive must contain description.xml file with 
  application description (title, description text, screenshots, etc.). This description.xml file contains 
  links to the other files in the archive like APK file(s), screenshots, promo graphics, video, etc. The main sections
  of the description.xml file are:
  <ul>
    <li>Category information</li>
    <li>Text description (title, short description, full description, keywords, etc)</li>
    <li>Images (app icon, screenshots, promo images)</li>
    <li>Videos</li>
    <li>Contant rating information</li>
    <li>Availability (country list, etc)</li>
    <li>Prices</li>
    <li>Requirements (you can specify supported devices if different from the APK file manifest)</li>
    <li>Testing instructions</li>
    <li>Consent</li>
    <li>Customer-support information</li>
    <li>Store specific section</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Specification</h3>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p>
  We have just started the project and already have commitment from three big appstores that they will support AppDF.
</p>

<h4>I represent an Android application store and we want to support AppDF, what should we do?</h4>
<p>
  You can just take <a href="https://github.com/onepf/AppDF/blob/master/specification/appds_spec_1_0.md">current specification draft</a> and
  implement it in your store. But we suggest joining <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/appdf">our mailing list</a> and contacting us.
  We are developing reference AppDF parsers now that could make it easier for you to integrate AppDF support to your store.
